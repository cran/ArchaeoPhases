Description: Provides a list of functions for the statistical analysis of archaeological dates and groups of dates (see <doi:10.18637/jss.v093.c01> for a description). It is based on the post-processing of the Markov Chains whose stationary distribution is the posterior distribution of a series of dates. Such output can be simulated by different applications as for instance 'ChronoModel' (see <http://www.chronomodel.fr>), 'Oxcal' (see <https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/oxcal.html>) or 'BCal' (see <http://bcal.shef.ac.uk/>). The only requirement is to have a csv file containing a sample from the posterior distribution.
